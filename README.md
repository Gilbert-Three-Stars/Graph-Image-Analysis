# Graph-Image-Analysis
# Description
Currently, the aim of this project is to take an image of a scatter plot
and then use that image to do a couple things with that image.
1. Find line of best fit
2. Put all the points from the image onto a matplotlib pyplot.
#
# How to use:
 Download the file and open it in an ide. Download whatever image that you want
 the program to work with and replace that image's file name with "test_graph_5.png" in main.
 Run the program and you should see that pyplot with the best fit line pop up.
